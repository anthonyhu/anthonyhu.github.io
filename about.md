### Education

I am a PhD Student in Computer Vision at Cambridge under the supervision of Prof. Roberto Cipolla. I graduated from 
Oxford University with an MSc in Applied Statistics, and prior to that I went to Telecom Paris, a French Engineering Grande Ecole. 

### Work experience
I'm currently a Computer Vision Intern at Wayve, a start-up whose goal is to bring autonomous technology to the world.
Before that, I did an internship at Spotify where I worked on large-scale musical similarities using raw audio.
