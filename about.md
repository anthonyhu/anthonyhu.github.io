My research is on representation learning from video (motion, geometry, semantics), and policy learning 
(imitation, reinforcement) for intelligent robots.

### Education

I am a PhD student in Computer Vision at Cambridge University, under the supervision of Prof. Roberto Cipolla. I graduated from 
Oxford University with an MSc in Statistical Science, and prior to that I went to Telecom Paris, a French Engineering Grande Ecole.

### Work experience
I'm currently a Research Intern at Wayve, a start-up whose goal is to bring autonomous technology to the world.
Before that, I did an internship at Spotify where I worked on large-scale musical similarities using raw audio.
