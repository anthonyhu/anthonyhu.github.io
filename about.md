My research is on representation learning from video (geometry, semantics, motion), and policy learning 
(imitation, reinforcement) for intelligent robots.

I did my PhD in Computer Vision at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Alex Kendall and Roberto Cipolla.
Prior to that I went to Telecom Paris, a French Engineering Grande Ecole, and I graduated from the University of Oxford with an MSc in Statistical Science.
