Audio-based cover song detection has received much
attention in the MIR community in the recent years. To
date, the most popular formulation of the problem has been
to compare the audio signals of two tracks and to make a
binary decision based on this information only. However,
leveraging additional signals might be key if one wants
to solve the problem at an industrial scale. In this paper,
we introduce an ensemble-based method that approaches
the problem from a many-to-many perspective. Instead of
considering pairs of tracks in isolation, we consider larger
sets of potential versions for a given composition, and create
and exploit the graph of relationships between these tracks.
We show that this can result in a significant improvement
in performance, in particular when the number of existing
versions of a given composition is large.
