Efficient integration of solar energy into the electricity mix depends on a reliable anticipation of its 
intermittency. A promising approach to forecast the temporal variability of solar irradiance resulting from the cloud
 cover dynamics, is based on the analysis of sequences of ground-taken sky images. Despite encouraging results, a recurrent limitation of current Deep Learning approaches lies in the ubiquitous tendency of reacting to past 
 observations rather than actively anticipating future events. This leads to a systematic temporal lag and little 
 ability to predict sudden events. To address this challenge, we introduce ECLIPSE, a spatiotemporal neural network 
 architecture that models cloud motion from sky images to predict both future segmented images and corresponding 
 irradiance levels. We show that 
 ECLIPSE anticipates critical events and considerably reduces temporal delay while generating visually realistic futures.
